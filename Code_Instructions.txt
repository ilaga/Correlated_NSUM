
Step 1. Data Preperation
	Details: Process the Ukraine survey to be usable by network scale-up models
	(a) Ukraine_Preparation.R
		Reads in the Ukraine .xlsx file, removes missing data and unused columns, and saves the data in three files:
		1. Ukraine_y.csv: Aggregated relational data responses
		2. Ukraine_x_cov.csv: Respondent covariate information (including intercept term)
		3. resplevel_Ukraine_Z_cov.csv: Respondent-level level of respect information
		Additionally, this file generates the plots in Figure 1 of the manuscript
		
Step 2. Fit Ukraine Data
	Details: Fit the data using the Zheng et al. (2006) overdispersed and our proposed correlated NSUM models
	(a) Ukraine_overdispersed_analysis.R
		Fits the overdispersed NSUM model and saves relevant output. To be run using a multi-core server cluster, although can be easily adapted to run locally
	(b) Ukraine_correlated_analysis.R
		Fits the correlated NSUM model and saves relevant output. To be run using a multi-core server cluster, although can be easily adapted to run locally
		
Step 3. Analyze Results
	Details: Analyze the output from the fitted models and generate all result plots and tables in the manuscript and supplementary material
	(a) Ukraine_Results.R
		Reads in results and generates plots and tables
		
Step 4. Simulation and Numerical Study
	Details: Implements the simulation study in Section 6 and Supplementary Section 4
	(a) Simulation_analysis.R
		Simulates data and fits one of the assumed models in Section 6
	(b) Simulation_Results.R
		Analyzes the simulation results and creates the plots for Figure 5 
	(c) Misspecified_covariate.R
		Performs the numerical analysis for the misspecified model with no covariates
	(d) Misspecified_correlation.R
		Performs the numerical analysis for the misspecified model with no correlation
